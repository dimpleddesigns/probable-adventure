Dimpleddesigns- All About Style.
Iâ€™m Julian Fakeye an LA based fashion designer, my job is to make every woman and bride feel beautiful, elegant and classy, at the same time, make their dreams a reality.
My love for fashion was born out of helping my Aunt who owned a bridal store hand stitch beads and stones into wedding dresses in perfect harmonious order.
As a child, I perceived this as being punished because I thought I should be playing outside or watching TV with my cousins. 
My sister and I were guided on how to hand stitch gems and stones into bridal gowns at a young age and by young I was  about 8 or 10 years of age.
However, growing up and developing a massive passion for creating beautiful dresses, I realized that my childhood and the opportunity I was given was a blessing in disguise.
Today I have so much love and talent in creating and designing beautiful, elegant  wedding and evening dresses, and I have a gift of identifying colors and trims.
Therefore, learning how to work with beautiful bridals gowns at a young age was a stepping stone into making me who I am today. - ## Be Beautiful, Be Classy, Be Elegant...
